Ai-Rec is a tool that allows users to gain insights into budgeting and investing. It facilitates importing user transactions to provide an analysis of the user's spending habits and uses those as the basis to provide investment suggestions.

Investment suggestions are provided in the form of stocks that trade on the NYSE as of now. 
This app was built using Svelte and Javascript.
